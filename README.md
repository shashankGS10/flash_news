# Flash News

Flash News is a React Native application built using the Expo framework. This app leverages the [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch the latest news headlines and provides a user-friendly interface to browse and read news articles.

## Features

- **React Native**: Built with React Native for cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Expo**: Utilized Expo for streamlined development and testing.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed codebase for better maintainability and fewer bugs.
- **Redux**: State management using Redux.
- **Redux Saga**: Middleware for handling side effects like asynchronous API calls.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Smooth infinite scroll to load more news articles as the user scrolls.
